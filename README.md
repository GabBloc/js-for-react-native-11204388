Task 1: Array Manipulation
`arrayManipulation.js`
Takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

Task 2: Format Array Strings
`arrayManipulation.js`
Takes two arrays (an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`) and modifies each string based on its corresponding number. Capitalizes the string if the number is even, and converts it to lowercase if the number is odd.

Task 3: User Profile Creation
`userInfo.js`
Takes an array of names and an array of modified names from Task 2, and returns an array of objects each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
